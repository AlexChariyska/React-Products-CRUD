## Run the app

0. ```npm install```
0. ```npm start```

http://localhost:3000/ - the application
http://localhost:5000/ - the rest API

For Windows the npm run start command starts only the first server, so to start the second one run: node rest-server on a second cmd

## Build the app
```npm run build```

This will build the app into the "dist" directory in the root of the project. It contains the index.html along with the minified assets, ready for production.
